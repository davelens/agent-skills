How it works[](#how-it-works)

Scrollspy toggles the .active class on anchor (<a>) elements when the element with the id referenced by the anchor’s href is scrolled into view. Scrollspy is best used in conjunction with a Bootstrap nav component or list group, but it will also work with any anchor elements in the current page. Here’s how it works.

- To start, scrollspy requires two things: a navigation, list group, or a simple set of links, plus a scrollable container. The scrollable container can be the <body> or a custom element with a set height and overflow-y: scroll.
- On the scrollable container, add data-bs-spy="scroll" and data-bs-target="#navId" where navId is the unique id of the associated navigation. If there is no focusable element inside the element, be sure to also include a tabindex="0" to ensure keyboard access.
- As you scroll the “spied” container, an .active class is added and removed from anchor links within the associated navigation. Links must have resolvable id targets, otherwise they’re ignored. For example, a <a href="#home">home</a> must correspond to something in the DOM like <div id="home"></div>
- Target elements that are not visible will be ignored. See the Non-visible elements section below.

Examples[](#examples)

Navbar[](#navbar)

Scroll the area below the navbar and watch the active class change. Open the dropdown menu and watch the dropdown items be highlighted as well.

Nested nav[](#nested-nav)

Scrollspy also works with nested .navs. If a nested .nav is .active, its parents will also be .active. Scroll the area next to the navbar and watch the active class change.

Simple anchors[](#simple-anchors)

Non-visible elements[](#non-visible-elements)

Target elements that aren’t visible will be ignored and their corresponding nav items won’t receive an .active class. Scrollspy instances initialized in a non-visible wrapper will ignore all target elements. Use the refresh method to check for observable elements once the wrapper becomes visible.

```js
document.querySelectorAll('#nav-tab>[data-bs-toggle="tab"]').forEach(el => {
  el.addEventListener('shown.bs.tab', () => {
    const target = el.getAttribute('data-bs-target')
    const scrollElem = document.querySelector(`${target} [data-bs-spy="scroll"]`)
    bootstrap.ScrollSpy.getOrCreateInstance(scrollElem).refresh()
  })
})
```

Usage[](#usage)

Via data attributes[](#via-data-attributes)

To easily add scrollspy behavior to your topbar navigation, add data-bs-spy="scroll" to the element you want to spy on (most typically this would be the <body>). Then add the data-bs-target attribute with the id or class name of the parent element of any Bootstrap .nav component.

```html
<body data-bs-spy="scroll" data-bs-target="#navbar-example">
  ...
  <div id="navbar-example">
    <ul class="nav nav-tabs" role="tablist">
      ...
    </ul>
  </div>
  ...
</body>
```

Via JavaScript[](#via-javascript)

```js
const scrollSpy = new bootstrap.ScrollSpy(document.body, {
  target: '#navbar-example'
})
```

Options[](#options)

As options can be passed via data attributes or JavaScript, you can append an option name to data-bs-, as in data-bs-animation="{value}". Make sure to change the case type of the option name from “camelCase” to “kebab-case” when passing the options via data attributes. For example, use data-bs-custom-class="beautifier" instead of data-bs-customClass="beautifier".

As of Bootstrap 5.2.0, all components support an experimental reserved data attribute data-bs-config that can house simple component configuration as a JSON string. When an element has data-bs-config='{"delay":0, "title":123}' and data-bs-title="456" attributes, the final title value will be 456 and the separate data attributes will override values given on data-bs-config. In addition, existing data attributes are able to house JSON values like data-bs-delay='{"show":0,"hide":150}'.

The final configuration object is the merged result of data-bs-config, data-bs-, and js object where the latest given key-value overrides the others.

Deprecated Options

Up until v5.1.3 we were using offset & method options, which are now deprecated and replaced by rootMargin. To keep backwards compatibility, we will continue to parse a given offset to rootMargin, but this feature will be removed in v6.

Methods[](#methods)

MethodDescriptiondisposeDestroys an element’s scrollspy. (Removes stored data on the DOM element)getInstanceStatic method to get the scrollspy instance associated with a DOM element.getOrCreateInstanceStatic method to get the scrollspy instance associated with a DOM element, or to create a new one in case it wasn’t initialized.refreshWhen adding or removing elements in the DOM, you’ll need to call the refresh method.

Here’s an example using the refresh method:

```js
const dataSpyList = document.querySelectorAll('[data-bs-spy="scroll"]')
dataSpyList.forEach(dataSpyEl => {
  bootstrap.ScrollSpy.getInstance(dataSpyEl).refresh()
})
```

Events[](#events)

EventDescriptionactivate.bs.scrollspyThis event fires on the scroll element whenever an anchor is activated by the scrollspy.

```js
const firstScrollSpyEl = document.querySelector('[data-bs-spy="scroll"]')
firstScrollSpyEl.addEventListener('activate.bs.scrollspy', () => {
  // do something...
})
```
