Object fit

Use the object fit utilities to modify how the content of a replaced element, such as an <img> or <video>, should be resized to fit its container.

How it works[](#how-it-works)

Change the value of the object-fit property with our responsive object-fit utility classes. This property tells the content to fill the parent container in a variety of ways, such as preserving the aspect ratio or stretching to take up as much space as possible.

Classes for the value of object-fit are named using the format .object-fit-{value}. Choose from the following values:

- contain
- cover
- fill
- scale (for scale-down)
- none

Examples[](#examples)

Add the object-fit-{value} class to the replaced element:

    

html

```html
<img src="..." class="object-fit-contain border rounded" alt="...">
<img src="..." class="object-fit-cover border rounded" alt="...">
<img src="..." class="object-fit-fill border rounded" alt="...">
<img src="..." class="object-fit-scale border rounded" alt="...">
<img src="..." class="object-fit-none border rounded" alt="...">
```

Responsive[](#responsive)

Responsive variations also exist for each object-fit value using the format .object-fit-{breakpoint}-{value}, for the following breakpoint abbreviations: sm, md, lg, xl, and xxl. Classes can be combined for various effects as you need.

    

html

```html
<img src="..." class="object-fit-sm-contain border rounded" alt="...">
<img src="..." class="object-fit-md-contain border rounded" alt="...">
<img src="..." class="object-fit-lg-contain border rounded" alt="...">
<img src="..." class="object-fit-xl-contain border rounded" alt="...">
<img src="..." class="object-fit-xxl-contain border rounded" alt="...">
```

Video[](#video)

The .object-fit-{value} and responsive .object-fit-{breakpoint}-{value} utilities also work on <video> elements.

```html
<video src="..." class="object-fit-contain" autoplay></video>
<video src="..." class="object-fit-cover" autoplay></video>
<video src="..." class="object-fit-fill" autoplay></video>
<video src="..." class="object-fit-scale" autoplay></video>
<video src="..." class="object-fit-none" autoplay></video>
```

Sass utilities API[](#sass-utilities-api)

Object fit utilities are declared in our utilities API in scss/_utilities.scss. Learn how to use the utilities API.

scss/\utilities.scss

```scss
"object-fit": (
  responsive: true,
  property: object-fit,
  values: (
    contain: contain,
    cover: cover,
    fill: fill,
    scale: scale-down,
    none: none,
  )
