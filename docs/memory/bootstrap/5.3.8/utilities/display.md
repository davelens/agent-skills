How it works[](#how-it-works)

Change the value of the display property with our responsive display utility classes. We purposely support only a subset of all possible values for display. Classes can be combined for various effects as you need.

Notation[](#notation)

Display utility classes that apply to all breakpoints, from xs to xxl, have no breakpoint abbreviation in them. This is because those classes are applied from min-width: 0; and up, and thus are not bound by a media query. The remaining breakpoints, however, do include a breakpoint abbreviation.

As such, the classes are named using the format:

- .d-{value} for xs
- .d-{breakpoint}-{value} for sm, md, lg, xl, and xxl.

Where value is one of:

- none
- inline
- inline-block
- block
- grid
- inline-grid
- table
- table-cell
- table-row
- flex
- inline-flex

The display values can be altered by changing the display values defined in $utilities and recompiling the SCSS.

The media queries affect screen widths with the given breakpoint or larger. For example, .d-lg-none sets display: none; on lg, xl, and xxl screens.

Examples[](#examples)

d-inline

d-inline

html

```html
<div class="d-inline p-2 text-bg-primary">d-inline</div>
<div class="d-inline p-2 text-bg-dark">d-inline</div>
```

d-block d-block

html

```html
<span class="d-block p-2 text-bg-primary">d-block</span>
<span class="d-block p-2 text-bg-dark">d-block</span>
```

Hiding elements[](#hiding-elements)

For faster mobile-friendly development, use responsive display classes for showing and hiding elements by device. Avoid creating entirely different versions of the same site, instead hide elements responsively for each screen size.

To hide elements simply use the .d-none class or one of the .d-{sm,md,lg,xl,xxl}-none classes for any responsive screen variation.

To show an element only on a given interval of screen sizes you can combine one .d--none class with a .d--* class, for example .d-none .d-md-block .d-xl-none will hide the element for all screen sizes except on medium and large devices.

hide on screens smaller than lg

html

```html
<div class="d-lg-none">hide on lg and wider screens</div>
<div class="d-none d-lg-block">hide on screens smaller than lg</div>
```

Display in print[](#display-in-print)

Change the display value of elements when printing with our print display utility classes. Includes support for the same display values as our responsive .d-* utilities.

- .d-print-none
- .d-print-inline
- .d-print-inline-block
- .d-print-block
- .d-print-grid
- .d-print-inline-grid
- .d-print-table
- .d-print-table-row
- .d-print-table-cell
- .d-print-flex
- .d-print-inline-flex

The print and display classes can be combined.

Screen Only (Hide on print only)

Print Only (Hide on screen only)

Hide up to large on screen, but always show on print

html

```html
<div class="d-print-none">Screen Only (Hide on print only)</div>
<div class="d-none d-print-block">Print Only (Hide on screen only)</div>
<div class="d-none d-lg-block d-print-block">Hide up to large on screen, but always show on print</div>
```

Sass utilities API[](#sass-utilities-api)

Display utilities are declared in our utilities API in scss/_utilities.scss. Learn how to use the utilities API.

scss/\utilities.scss

```scss
"display": (
  responsive: true,
  print: true,
  property: display,
  class: d,
  values: inline inline-block block grid inline-grid table table-row table-cell flex inline-flex none
),
```
