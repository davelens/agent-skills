WlSessionLock: Reloadable

import Quickshell.Wayland

Wayland session lock implemented using the ext\session\lock\_v1 protocol.

WlSessionLock will create an instance of its surface component for every screen when locked is set to true. The surface component must create a WlSessionLockSurface which will be displayed on each screen.

The below example will create a session lock that disappears when the button is clicked.

```
WlSessionLock {
  id: lock

  WlSessionLockSurface {
    Button {
      text: "unlock me"
      onClicked: lock.locked = false
    }
  }
}

// ...
lock.locked = true
```

WARNING

If the WlSessionLock is destroyed or quickshell exits without setting locked to false, conformant compositors will leave the screen locked and painted with a solid color.

This is what makes the session lock secure. The lock dying will not expose your session, but it will render it inoperable.
